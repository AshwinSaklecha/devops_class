# Introduction to CI/CD

## What is CI/CD?
- **CI** - Continuous Integration
- **CD** - Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment
- Automates software delivery process

## Continuous Integration
- Developers merge code frequently
- Each merge triggers automated build
- Run automated tests on every commit
- Catch bugs early

## Continuous Delivery
- Code is always in deployable state
- Automated release to staging
- Manual approval for production

## Continuous Deployment
- Every change goes to production automatically
- No manual intervention needed
- Requires robust testing

## CI/CD Pipeline Stages
1. Source - Code commit triggers pipeline
2. Build - Compile code, create artifacts
3. Test - Unit tests, integration tests
4. Deploy - Push to staging/production

## Benefits
- Faster releases
- Reduced manual errors
- Quick feedback loop
- Consistent deployments

## Popular CI/CD Tools
- Jenkins
- GitHub Actions
- GitLab CI
- CircleCI
- Azure DevOps

## Key Concepts
- Pipeline as code
- Infrastructure as code
- Automated testing
- Version control everything

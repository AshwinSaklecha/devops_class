# Docker Volumes

## What are Docker Volumes?
- Volumes are used to persist data generated by containers
- Data inside containers is lost when container is removed
- Volumes store data outside the container filesystem

## Types of Mounting
1. **Bind Mount** - Maps host directory to container directory
2. **Volume** - Docker manages the storage location
3. **tmpfs** - Stored in memory only

## Common Commands
```bash
# Create a volume
docker volume create myvolume

# List volumes
docker volume ls

# Inspect a volume
docker volume inspect myvolume

# Run container with volume
docker run -v myvolume:/app/data nginx

# Bind mount example
docker run -v /host/path:/container/path nginx

# Remove volume
docker volume rm myvolume
```

## Key Points
- Volumes persist even after container is deleted
- Multiple containers can share same volume
- Use volumes for databases and important data
